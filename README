criu
====

An utility to checkpoint/restore tasks. Using this tool, you can
freeze a running application (or part of it) and checkpoint it to
a hard drive as a collection of files. You can then use the files
to restore and run the application from the point it was frozen
at. The distinctive feature of the CRIU project is that it is
mainly implemented in user space.

The project home is at http://criu.org
